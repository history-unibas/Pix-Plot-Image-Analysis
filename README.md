# Pix-Plot-Image-Analysis
This repository contains Python scripts for analysing image clusters generated with PixPlot.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer (only on Python 3.10 tested)
- Packages: see requirements.txt

## Notes
- These scripts were developed as part of the following research project: https://dg.philhist.unibas.ch/de/bereiche/mittelalter/forschung/oekonomien-des-raums/
- Information on PixPlot can be found at https://github.com/YaleDHLab/pix-plot.

## clusterImages.py
With the help of this script, the image cluster results of PixPlot were validated. In our use case, we wanted to identify a group of images ("Brandlagerb√ºcher"). The script distinguishes between clusters generated by PixPlot and user clusters (hotspot) generated by PixPlot.
